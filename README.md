New todo items ( 2021 )

    - comparison reports should be saved to a DB 
    - switch between data types


Old todo items (  years ago ):

   - do something about trailing slashes when paths ar concatenated
   - Auto Compare
	     - figure out the newest and second newest reports
	     - automatically check for changes in last two runs
			 - do this for last two runs with same report name
			    (ex: so only reports with name "nightly scheduled" will be compared and not "adhoc report" )
	 - daemon the schedules runs
	     - schedule runs, save reports
	     - have alerts ( email, etc.)
	 - GUI
	 - daemon status viewer
	 - report viewer

	 - not searching for new files for efficiency,
	 				maybe think about this later as an option

	 - ctime, atime etc
